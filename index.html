      <h2>Objective</h2>
    </div>
    <p>My objective is to become the best coder and builder that I can. It's my long-term goal to start a company that will make the world a better and more enjoyable place. I think it's not just about the end goal though, it's also about the journey. I believe that the greatest transformations occur, both professionally and personally, with a combination of creativity, teamwork, research, and risk-taking.
